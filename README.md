What Is Creator Chain Testnet?
Creator Chain Testnet is a testnet for Creator Chain. Creator Chain is a Layer 2 blockchain that is built using Optimism's OP Stack, so just like Optimism it uses optimistic rollup technology. Creator Chain is focused on providing cheap and fast transactions, while enabling developers to earn a share of the network's revenue. The native token of Creator Chain Testnet is CETH.
